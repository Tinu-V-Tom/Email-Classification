# Email-Classification
# Email Classification Project

This project is an email classification system designed to classify emails into categories such as spam and not spam. The model is trained on an imbalanced dataset and uses smote technique  to handle class imbalance. The final model is deployed using Streamlit for easy accessibility and user interaction

## Project Description
The email classification project aims to provide a robust solution for classifying emails into spam and non-spam categories. The project involves data preprocessing, handling class imbalance using SMOTE, model training, and deployment using Streamlit.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model consists of emails labeled as spam or not spam. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, text cleaning, and feature extraction.

## Model Deployment
The model is deployed using Streamlit. 

### Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles text cleaning and feature extraction.
- **Model Training**: Trains a Decision Tree Classifier after observing the model performances of logistic regression,SVC,KNN etc.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the model using classification metrics.
- **Web Interface**: Provides a user-friendly interface to classify emails.

### Evaluation
The model is evaluated using  metrics such as accuracy_score,classification_report and confusion_matrix .it provides a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance.
